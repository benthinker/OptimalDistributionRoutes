        Have a look at the pseudo-code shown in class for A*. Here you should implement the same in python.
        Have a look at the implementation of `BestFirstSearch` to have better understanding.
        Use `self.open` (SearchNodesPriorityQueue) and `self.close` (SearchNodesCollection) data structures.
        These data structures are implemented in `graph_search/best_first_search.py`.

              solution is found, as done in the pseudo-code taught in class (better solution has a strictly
              smaller g-score).
